# Programming Challenge: Monty Python
# In a .py file, create a program and use input() three times to get answers to the
#     following questions from a user.  Store each of the answers in a variable.
# What is your name?
name = input("What is your name? ")
# What is your quest?
quest = input("What is your quest? ")
# What is your favorite color?
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
# Then, concatenate everything into a string within a print() statement with the
#     form "So your name is [name], your quest is [quest], and your favorite color is [color]."
print("So your name is " + name + ", your quest is " + quest + ", and your favorite color is " + color + ".")

# SOLUTION
# name = input("What is your name?")
# quest = input("What is your quest?")
# color = input("What is your favorite color?")
# print("So your name is " + name + ", your quest is " + quest + ", and your favorite color is " + color + ".")
