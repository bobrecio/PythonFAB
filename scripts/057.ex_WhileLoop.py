# For this exercise, you will print 10 descending integers starting from 10 and ending at 1 with each
# integer being 1 less than the last and each integer printed on a new line.
#
# Create a variable and assign it the integer 10.
countdown = 10
# Then, print
# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# in the output by using a while loop to print numbers while the variable does not equal 0.
# Use the -= operator to reassign descending values to the variable.
while countdown:
    print (str(countdown))
    countdown -= 1

#SOLUTION
# dec_int = 10
#
# while dec_int != 0:
#     print(dec_int)
#     dec_int -= 1
