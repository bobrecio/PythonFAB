# type(), str(), and escape sequences exercises
# Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm.
# Create a variable and assign it a float
flt_a = 11/4
# Use print() and type() to print the data type of the variable in the output
print(type(flt_a))
# Use str() on the variable from step 1 and concatenate it with the string " is a float."
# then use print() to display the result
print(str(flt_a) + " is a float")
# print() the string "Hello, I'm [name], it's nice to meet you!"
print("Hello, I\'m [name], it\'s nice to meet you!")
# including quotes (you will need to use the \' or \" escape sequence
# depending on whether you enclose your strings in single quotes or double quotes.)

# solution
# float_num = 6.7                                     # variable that has been assigned a float
# print(type(float_num))                              # prints the type of float_num
# print(str(float_num) + " is a float.")              # prints "6.7 is a float."
# print("\"Hello, I'm Aaron, it's nice to meet you!\"")  # prints "Hello, I'm Aaron, it's nice to meet you!"
